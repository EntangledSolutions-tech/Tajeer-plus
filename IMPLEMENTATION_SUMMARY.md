# Implementation Summary: User Data Isolation & Branch-Based Filtering

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Added `branch_id` column to `customers` table
- ✅ Added `branch_id` column to `contracts` table
- ✅ Added `branch_id` column to `vehicles` table (existing)
- ✅ Created foreign key constraints to `branches` table
- ✅ Added indexes for performance
- ✅ Migration file: `20250208000001_add_branch_id_to_customers_and_contracts.sql`

### 2. User Authentication & Data Isolation Fixed
- ✅ Vehicles API now filters by `user_id` (was commented out)
- ✅ Customers API already filters by `user_id`
- ✅ Contracts API already filters by `user_id`
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce user isolation at database level

### 3. Branch-Based Filtering (List Views)
All list APIs now support optional `branch_id` query parameter:
- ✅ `/api/vehicles` - Filters by selected branch
- ✅ `/api/customers` - Filters by selected branch
- ✅ `/api/contracts` - Filters by selected branch

Frontend list components automatically pass selected branch:
- ✅ `VehicleList` - Includes `selectedBranch.id` in API calls
- ✅ `CustomerList` - Includes `selectedBranch.id` in API calls
- ✅ `ContractsList` - Includes `selectedBranch.id` in API calls

### 4. Branch Requirement for Creation
All creation APIs now require `branch_id`:
- ✅ POST `/api/vehicles` - Validates branch_id exists
- ✅ POST `/api/customers` - Validates branch_id exists
- ✅ POST `/api/contracts` - Validates branch_id exists
- ✅ POST `/api/add-vehicle` - Validates branch_id exists

Frontend modals validate branch selection:
- ✅ `VehicleModal` - Checks branch selected before submission
- ✅ `CustomerModal` - Checks branch selected before submission
- ✅ `ContractModal` - Checks branch selected before submission

### 5. URL Manipulation Protection (Detail Views)
Enhanced security for detail endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/vehicles/[id]` - Validates user_id + branch_id
- ✅ `GET /api/customers/[id]` - Validates user_id + branch_id
- ✅ `GET /api/contracts/[id]` - **NEWLY CREATED** - Validates user_id + branch_id

Frontend detail pages handle unauthorized access:
- ✅ `VehicleDetails` - Detects 403, shows toast, redirects to /home
- ✅ `CustomerDetails` - Detects 403, shows toast, redirects to /home
- ✅ `ContractDetails` - Detects 403, shows toast, redirects to /home

### 6. HTTP Service Enhanced
- ✅ Added `status` property to `HttpResponse` interface
- ✅ All methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) now return HTTP status codes
- ✅ Enables proper 403 Forbidden detection on frontend

### 7. Database Cleanup
- ✅ Removed sample vehicle seed data (`20250131000006_add_sample_vehicles.sql`)
- ✅ Fixed duplicate migration files (consolidated `20250130000001` files)

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Layer 1: Database (PostgreSQL RLS)
```sql
-- Example: Vehicles table RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own vehicles" ON public.vehicles
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
- Enforced at database level
- Cannot be bypassed even if application logic fails
- Applies to all data access

### Layer 2: API Validation
```typescript
// List endpoints
query = query.eq('user_id', user.id);  // Always filter by user
if (branchId) {
  query = query.eq('branch_id', branchId);  // Optionally filter by branch
}

// Detail endpoints
query = query
  .eq('id', recordId)
  .eq('user_id', user.id)        // Must match user
  .eq('branch_id', branchId);    // Must match branch
```
- Double validation: user_id + branch_id
- Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized
- Clear error messages

### Layer 3: Frontend Protection
```typescript
// Check for unauthorized access
if (response.error?.includes('access denied') || response.status === 403) {
  toast.error('Access denied: This record belongs to a different branch or user');
  router.push('/home');
  return;
}
```
- Detects 403 responses
- Shows user-friendly toast notification
- Automatically redirects to home
- Prevents rendering unauthorized data

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Creating Records
1. User must select a branch from branch selector
2. Create vehicle/customer/contract through modal
3. Modal validates branch is selected
4. API receives branch_id + user_id (auto-added)
5. Record created with both IDs

### Viewing Lists
1. User selects a branch (or views all if no branch selected)
2. List component fetches data with branch_id filter
3. Only records for that user + branch are returned
4. Switching branches refetches data automatically

### Viewing Details
1. User clicks on a record or types URL
2. Frontend passes branch_id in API request
3. API validates user_id + branch_id match
4. If authorized: data returned and displayed
5. If unauthorized: 403 error → toast → redirect to /home

### Attempting Unauthorized Access
1. User types URL for another user's record
2. API checks user_id - doesn't match - returns 403
3. Frontend shows: "Access denied: This record belongs to a different user"
4. Auto-redirect to /home

1. User types URL for different branch's record
2. API checks branch_id - doesn't match - returns 403
3. Frontend shows: "Access denied: This record belongs to a different branch"
4. Auto-redirect to /home

## 📊 What Changed

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Vehicles API | ❌ user_id filter commented out | ✅ Filters by user_id + optional branch_id |
| Customers API | ✅ Filters by user_id | ✅ Filters by user_id + optional branch_id |
| Contracts API | ✅ Filters by user_id | ✅ Filters by user_id + optional branch_id |
| Vehicle Details | ❌ No branch validation | ✅ Validates user + branch, redirects if unauthorized |

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Run these commands to apply migrations:

```bash
# For cloud/production database
pnpm supabase:cloud:reset

# Or to just push new migrations
npx supabase db push
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] User A cannot see User B's data
- [ ] Switching branches shows only that branch's data
- [ ] Creating without branch selected shows error
- [ ] Creating with branch selected works correctly
- [ ] Typing URL for different user's record redirects with toast
- [ ] Typing URL for different branch's record redirects with toast
- [ ] All data is properly isolated by user AND branch
